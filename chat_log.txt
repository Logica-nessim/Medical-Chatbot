User: im 22 years old what do you recommend to do?
Bot:  There are several common causes of headaches in the front part of the head. These include tension headaches, sinus headaches, and migraines. Tension headaches are often caused by muscle tension in the neck and scalp, while sinus headaches are caused by inflammation or infection in the sinuses. Migraines can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, stress, and certain foods or environmental triggers.
To manage these types of headaches, there are several strategies you can try. For tension headaches, you can try techniques such as deep breathing, relaxation exercises, or massage therapy to help reduce muscle tension. For sinus headaches, you can try using nasal decongestants or saline nasal sprays to help reduce swelling in the sinuses. Migraines can be more challenging to manage, but there are several medications and other treatments that may be helpful, such as triptans, ergots, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It's also important to try to identify and avoid any triggers that may be causing your headaches.
If you are experiencing frequent or severe headaches, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.
