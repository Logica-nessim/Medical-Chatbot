To manage these types of headaches, there are several strategies you can try. For tension headaches, you can try techniques such as deep breathing, relaxation exercises, or massage therapy to help reduce muscle tension. For sinus headaches, you can try using nasal decongestants or saline nasal sprays to help reduce swelling in the sinuses. Migraines can be more challenging to manage, but there are several medications and other treatments that may be helpful, such as triptans, ergots, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It's also important to try to identify and avoid any triggers that may be causing your headaches.
